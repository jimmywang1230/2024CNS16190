Test units a) The TL shall assess for all password-based user authentication mechanisms in IXIT 1-AuthMech where passwords are not defined by the user according to \"Authentication Factor\" and used in any state other than the factory default whether the \"Password Generation Mechanism\" ensures that passwords are unique per device. Assignment of verdict The verdict PASS is assigned if: • each password of a password-based authentication mechanism being used in any state other than the factory default, that is not defined by the user, is unique per device.

Test units a) The TL shall functionally assess whether password-based authentication mechanisms that are not documented in IXIT 1-AuthMech are available via a network interface on the DUT or described in the user manual. EXAMPLE: Network scanning tools allow for discovery of network-based authentication mechanisms. b) For each password-based user authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech, the TL shall functionally check whether the user is required to define all passwords that are user-defined according to \"Authentication Factor\" before being used. c) The TL shall functionally assess whether all passwords of the DUT, that are not defined by the user according to \"Authentication Factor\" in IXIT 1-AuthMech and used in any state other than the factory default, do not violate the description of the \"Password Generation Mechanism\". Assignment of verdict The verdict PASS is assigned if: • every discovered password-based authentication mechanism is documented in the IXIT; and • the user is required to define all passwords before being used, that are stated as defined by the user in the IXIT; and • there is no indication that the generation of a not user-defined password of the DUT used in any state other than the factory default differs from the generation mechanism described in the IXIT.

    "# Intermediate answer: 5.1.1 Test group 5.1-1 5.1.1.0 Test group objective The test group addresses the provision 5.1-1. This test group addresses all states of the DUT with the exception of factory default. 5.1.1.1 Test case 5.1-1-1 (conceptual) Test purpose The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the password-based authentication mechanisms. Test units a) The TL shall assess for all password-based user authentication mechanisms in IXIT 1-AuthMech where passwords are not defined by the user according to \"Authentication Factor\" and used in any state other than the factory default whether the \"Password Generation Mechanism\" ensures that passwords are unique per device. Assignment of verdict The verdict PASS is assigned if: • each password of a password-based authentication mechanism being used in any state other than the factory default, that is not defined by the user, is unique per device. The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise. 5.1.1.2 Test case 5.1-1-2 (functional) Test purpose The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the password-based authentication mechanisms concerning the completeness of the IXIT documentation a), the passwords defined by the user b) and the generation mechanisms c). Test units a) The TL shall functionally assess whether password-based authentication mechanisms that are not documented in IXIT 1-AuthMech are available via a network interface on the DUT or described in the user manual. EXAMPLE: Network scanning tools allow for discovery of network-based authentication mechanisms. b) For each password-based user authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech, the TL shall functionally check whether the user is required to define all passwords that are user-defined according to \"Authentication Factor\" before being used. c) The TL shall functionally assess whether all passwords of the DUT, that are not defined by the user according to \"Authentication Factor\" in IXIT 1-AuthMech and used in any state other than the factory default, do not violate the description of the \"Password Generation Mechanism\". Assignment of verdict The verdict PASS is assigned if: • every discovered password-based authentication mechanism is documented in the IXIT; and • the user is required to define all passwords before being used, that are stated as defined by the user in the IXIT; and • there is no indication that the generation of a not user-defined password of the DUT used in any state other than the factory default differs from the generation mechanism described in the IXIT. The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.\\\n",

    "# So the final answer is: 問題：5.1.3 Test group 5.1-3 5.1.3.0 Test group objective The test group addresses the provision 5.1-3. According to ETSI TS 103 645 [1]/ETSI EN 303 645 [2] best practice cryptography is defined as cryptography that is suitable for the corresponding use case and has no indication of a feasible attack with current readily available techniques. The objective of this test group is to assess, firstly, whether the cryptographic methods provide the security guarantees that are necessary for the authentication mechanisms and, secondly, whether the cryptographic methods are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack.5.1.3.1 Test case 5.1-3-1 (conceptual) Test purpose The purpose of this test case is the conceptual assessment of the cryptography used for the authentication mechanisms concerning the use of best practice cryptography (a-c) and the vulnerability to a feasible attack d). Test units a) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL shall assess whether the \"Security Guarantees\" are appropriate for the use case of user authentication, at least integrity and authenticity are required to be fulfilled. b) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL shall assess whether the mechanism according to \"Description\" is appropriate to achieve the \"Security Guarantees\". NOTE 1: A holistic approach is required to assess the security of the mechanism. c) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL shall assess whether the \"Cryptographic Details\" are considered as best practice cryptography for the use case of user authentication based on a reference catalogue. If \"Cryptographic Details\" are not included in a reference catalogue for the corresponding use case (e.g. novel cryptography), the SO shall provide evidences, e.g. a risk analysis, to justify the cryptography is appropriate as best practice for the use case. In such case the TL shall assess whether the evidence is appropriate and reliable for the use case. NOTE 2: A use case based list of examples for best practice cryptography is given in ETSI TR 103 621 [i.7]. Moreover general reference catalogues of best practice cryptography are available, for example:  SOGIS Agreed Cryptographic Mechanisms (https://www.sogis.eu). NOTE 3: A cryptographic algorithm or primitive that is deprecated with regard to its desired security property (e.g. SHA1 for collision resistance) or that relies on a cryptographic parameter (e.g. key-size) that is not appropriate, taking into account the intended lifetime of the DUT and cryptoagility, cannot be considered as best practice cryptography. d) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL shall assess whether the \"Cryptographic Details\" are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security property on the base of the \"Security Guarantees\" by reference to competent cryptanalytic reports. NOTE 4: Competent cryptanalytic reports are typically published in the scientific literature or, alternatively, are to be provided by the SO. Further, clause D.2 provides information about the expected attack potential for level basic. Assignment of verdict The verdict PASS is assigned if for all user authentication mechanisms: • the security guarantees are appropriate for the use case of user authentication; and • the mechanism is appropriate to achieve the security guarantees with respect to the use case; and • all used cryptographic details are considered as best practice for the use case; and • all used cryptographic details are not known to be vulnerable to a feasible attack for the desired security property. The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise. 5.1.3.2 Test case 5.1-3-2 (functional) Test purpose The purpose of this test case is the functional assessment of the cryptography used for the authentication mechanisms.Test units a) For each authentication mechanism in IXIT 1-AuthMech used to authenticate users against the DUT, the TL shall functionally assess whether the described \"Cryptographic Details\" are used by the DUT. EXAMPLE 1: Using a protocol analyser or packet sniffer tool for network-based mechanisms. EXAMPLE 2: If a PKI certificate based authentication is used, sniffing the used certificates and comparing the properties with the described cryptography in the IXIT can be helpful to collect an indication. EXAMPLE 3: If the underlying communication protocol of the authentication mechanism enables different security modes for the communication, trying to downgrade the security mode can be helpful to collect an indication. Assignment of verdict The verdict PASS is assigned if: • there is no indication that any used cryptographic setting differs from its IXIT documentation. The verdict FAIL is assigned otherwise.\\\n",
    "#     範例2生成的測試情境(test scenario):與裝置所使用的身份驗證方法無關，身份驗證資料在使用者和裝置之間傳輸時應進行加密。注意：傳輸通常可以在行動應用程式和裝置之間進行。注意：密碼需要始終受到保護，加密是保護密碼的標準方法。 如果密碼未加密，則它們可以簡單地讀取（即明文）並且很容易洩漏。（範例：傳輸過程中的密碼保護通常可以透過 TLS/SSL 隧道連線或 VPN 進行）。問題：1. 當使用者向裝置進行身份驗證時，身份驗證資料在傳輸過程中如何進行加密保護？\\\n",
